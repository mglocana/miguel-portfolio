                <p>Brown bear, (Ursus arctos), shaggy-haired bear (family Ursidae) native to Europe, Asia, and northwestern North America. Numerous forms of the brown bear have been described; they are treated as several subspecies of Ursus arctos. One subspecies, the Kodiak bear (U. arctos middendorffi), weighs up to 720 kg (1,600 pounds) and is often considered to be the worldâ€™s largest carnivore, a title it shares with the polar bear (U. maritimus), which grows to a similar size. Although North American brown bears are traditionally called grizzlies, this common name refers formally to the subspecies U. arctos horribilis, which is widespread across northwestern North America.</p>

            <h2>Giraffes</h2>

                <p>These tip-top creatures stand in at 18 ft. tall, with a record height for the males of 19.3 ft. They have long legs, long necks, and relatively short bodies. Their heads are topped with bony horns, and their tails are tipped with a tuft of fur.

                    A short mane runs down the length of their long necks, and their coat is covered with a blotched/blocky pattern. Their base color is light cream, and their spots range from dark brown to burnt orange in color.</p>

            <h2>Lions</h2>

                <p>Lions have strong, compact bodies and powerful forelegs, teeth and jaws for pulling down and killing prey. Their coats are yellow-gold, and adult males have shaggy manes that range in color from blond to reddish-brown to black. The length and color of a lion's mane is likely determined by age, genetics and hormones. Young lions have light spotting on their coats that disappears as they grow.

                    Without their coats, lion and tiger bodies are so similar that only experts can tell them apart.</p>

                <p>Monkey, in general, any of nearly 200 species of tailed primate, with the exception of lemurs, tarsiers, and lorises. The presence of a tail (even if only a tiny nub), along with their narrow-chested bodies and other features of the skeleton, distinguishes monkeys from apes. Most monkeys have a short, relatively flat face without great prominence of the muzzle, although baboons and mandrills are notable exceptions. The vast majority of species live in tropical forests, where they move on all four limbs. </p>

            <h2>Alligators</h2>

                <li>Aspen</li>
                <li>Mika</li>
                <p>Both males and females have an "armored" body with a muscular, flat tail. The skin on their back is armored with embedded bony plates called osteoderms or scutes. They have four short legs; the front legs have five toes while the back legs have only four toes. Alligators have a long, rounded snout that has upward facing nostrils at the end; this allows breathing to occur while the rest of the body is underwater. The young have bright yellow stripes on the tail; adults have dark stripes on the tail.

                    It's easy to distinguish an alligator from a crocodile by the teeth. The large, fourth tooth in the lower jaw of an alligator fits into a socket in the upper jaw and is not visible when the mouth is closed. This does not happen in crocodiles. Alligators have between 74 and 80 teeth in their mouth at a time. As they wear down, they are replaced. An alligator can go through 3,000 teeth in a lifetime.</p>
