            Climbing is a workout for my brain and my body. Climbing forces me to confront and overcome my fear, anxiety and negative thoughts.<br> I'm a better person when I come back down to earth than I was when I left it.

            it gives me something to get excited and learn about. Just when you think you have it down, there is something new to learn, a trip to<br> plan or problem to solve. It also brings you to amazing places and most often it is with really good people too. I also love that you can<br> bond with people on the ground but also have your own sanctuary of peace up on the wall.

               Photography gets me out. It makes me see things I'd otherwise not see; Either around my city or traveling abroad. Its a fantastic hobby <br>that's best served when doing it solo. Being that I have a highly irregular work schedule, I'm out when no one else is.<br>
               It also gives me a chance to show the world how I view things or how the mundane can be turned into something exceptional<br> from my or a different view point.
               And as someone who struggles to draw the simplest of stick figures...<br>its made me realize I have at least one artistic bone in my body.

        <p>
            As a former truck driver, I had the fortunante chance to see the whole country and explore all of the marvels within it.<br>
            I love to travel because I love seeing new places. I love getting involved in new cultures, it has broadened and enriched my life.<br> It helps me gain perspective on the world around me and gives me a better understanding of humanity itself.<br> I am stronger for the challenges I have overcome, enlightened by the experience of it.
